  "description": "Create a single resource rest API with Express that's backed by Mongo. I'm leaving this pretty open to interpretation. I want you to write this from scratch, don't just copy and paste code from class or previous projects. Add a feature of Mongoose that we didn't use class, such as data validation.",
